DocuDroid is an intelligent web application built with Python, LangChain, and ChromaDB for **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based PDF analysis**. It can summarize PDFs, extract key points, and answer detailed, context-aware questions using semantic search and LLMs.

## 🚀 About The Project

DocuDroid solves the problem of quickly understanding complex PDF documents. Users can upload PDFs and the system will:

- Generate multiple types of summaries
- Extract key bullet points
- Answer questions in a conversational manner

It uses **vector embeddings stored in ChromaDB** to perform semantic search, meaning queries are understood by **meaning, not just keywords**. The interface is fully responsive via Streamlit, and all documents are processed securely in-memory.

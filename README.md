An intelligent web application built with Python that leverages the power of Google's Gemini Pro model to provide sophisticated analysis of PDF documents. IntelliDoc AI can generate multiple types of summaries and hold a detailed, context-aware conversation about the document's content.

## üöÄ About The Project

IntelliDoc AI was designed to solve a common problem: extracting meaningful insights from dense PDF documents quickly and efficiently. Instead of manually reading through pages, users can simply upload a document and let the AI do the heavy lifting. The application provides not just a simple summary, but also a powerful Q&A interface that allows users to "talk" to their documents.

The project features a stunning, fully responsive UI with an animated, glassmorphism-inspired theme, created entirely within Streamlit using custom CSS.
